RRP Divi - Child theme for Divi
===============================

This Wordpress Divi child theme provides a customized footer and an additional custom post type and related pages (archive, single, list).

The town extenstion allows a set of towns to be defined. A page under site.com/town/def_town is created on the fly with contents that are varied. This allows the site to easily add a page for a target market based on a town, without any additional work.

There is scope for this extension to be generalised such that the page content and structure comes from a template.

Note Divi is a theme available from elegantthemes.com
